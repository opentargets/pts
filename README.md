# PTS â€” Open Targets Pipeline Transformation Stage

Convert files into formats and structures used by the Open Targets data pipeline.


## Summary

This application uses the [Otter](http://github.com/opentargets/otter) library to
convert some input files into parquet, and transform some ontologies we use into
structures suitable for the Open Targets pipeline.

Check out the [config.yaml](config.yaml) file to see the steps and the tasks that
make them up.


## Installation and running

PTS uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as its package manager. It is compatible
with PIP, so you can also fall back to it if you feel more comfortable.


```bash
uv run pts -h
```

> [!TIP]
> You can also use PTS with [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). Running
> `make` without any target shows help.


### Running with Docker

You can also launch PTS with Docker:
```bash
docker run ghcr.io/opentargets/pts:latest -h
```

PTS can upload the files it fetches into different cloud storage services. Open
Targets uses Google Cloud. To enable it in a docker container, you must have a
credentials file. Assuming you do, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run \
  -v /path/to/credentials.json:/app/credentials.json \
  -e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/credentials.json \
  ghcr.io/opentargets/pts:latest -h
```

To build your own Docker image, run the following command from the root of the
repository:

```bash
docker build -t pts .
```


## Development

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to run `make dev` before starting development. This will set up a very
> simple git hook that does a few checks before committing.

Development of PTS can be done straight away in the local environment. You can run
the application just like before (`uv run pts`) to check the changes you make.

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at the [Otter docs](https://opentargets.github.io/otter), it is a
> very helpful guide when developing new tasks.

You can test the changes by running a small step, like `so`:

```bash
uv run pts --step so
```
